                        whatsoever and however caused, whether arising under contract, tort (including
                        negligence or breach of statutory duty) or otherwise, even if that Party has been
                        advised of its possibility.

                <div>
                    <p>19. The failure at any time of either Party to demand strict performance by the other
                        of any of the terms, covenants or conditions set forth herein shall not be construed
                        as a continuing waiver or relinquishment thereof, and either Party may, at any time,
                        demand strict and complete performance by the other of such terms, covenants and
                        conditions.

                <div>
                    <p>20. The Investors/Brand/Client First shall have no right to assign or transfer any of
                        its rights or obligations hereunder without the express prior written consent of the
                        Consultant. Provided however, the Consultant shall be entitled to freely assign or
                        transfer its rights or obligations pursuant to this Agreement with prior intimation
                        to the Investors/Brand/Client First.
                    </p>

                <div>
                    <p>21. The invalidity or unenforceability of any provision in this Agreement shall in no
                        way affect the validity or enforceability of any other provision herein. In the
                        event of the invalidity or unenforceability of any provision of this Agreement, the
                        Parties will immediately negotiate in good faith to replace such a provision with
                        another, which is not prohibited or unenforceable and has, as far as possible, the
                        same legal and commercial effect as that which it replaces.
                    </p>

                <div>
                    <p>22. Neither Party shall be liable for any loss to the other Party caused by the
                        failure to observe the terms and conditions of this Agreement, wherein such failure
                        is occasioned by any cause beyond the other Party’s reasonable control such as act
                        of God, war, insurrection, riot, fire, flood, epidemic, earthquake, strikes,
                        lock-outs, labor controversy, civil commotion, act of terrorism, any
                        change/repudiation of law, statute, act, rules, regulations, policies, bye-laws or
                        similar cause. The Party having any such cause shall promptly notify the other Party
                        in writing of the nature of such cause and the expected delay.
                    </p>

                <div>
                    <p>23. This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between the Parties with respect
                        to the subject matter of Agreement and supersedes all communications, negotiations
                        and agreements (whether written or oral) of Parties with respect thereto made prior
                        to the date of this Agreement.

                <div>
                    <p>24. No amendment or other variation of this Agreement shall be effective unless it is
                        in writing, is dated, expressly refers to this Agreement, and is signed by a duly
                        authorised representative of each Party.

                <div>
                    <p>25. It is agreed between the Parties that the relationship of Consultant with the
                        Investors/Brand/Client First is that of an independent contractor and that the
                        obligations and responsibilities of the Consultant to the Investors/Brand/Client
                        First are limited to those specifically set forth herein.

                </div>
                <div>
                    <p>26. Nothing in this Agreement shall be deemed to create any agency, partnership,
                        joint venture unincorporated association, co-operative entity or other joint
                        relationship between the Parties hereto or constitute any Party the agent of the
                        other Party for any purpose or entitle any Party to commit or bind the other Party
                        in any manner or give rise to fiduciary duties by one Party in favour of the other
                        Party.
                    </p>

                <div>
                    <p>27. The Consultant shall have the right to subcontract any part of its scope of work
                        or Services required to be rendered by it under this Agreement to any third party.
                        IN WITNESS WHEREOF the Parties hereto have set and subscribed their respective hands
